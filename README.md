# RecMathBlog
My take on a blog building tutorial on [Pride Parrot](http://prideparrot.com/blog/archive/2012/12/how_to_create_a_simple_blog_part1).

### My learning process
My process for learning involves following the tutorial then making changes to the code to address my particular needs. I'm currently in the process of making changes to Part II of the three part tutorial. As I continue out the tutorial and ultimately publish the blog I'm building I will post follow ups. 

### My blog and learning process
You can follow along with my learning process and other things I'm doing over at [BowTie Beej](http://bowtiebeej.com).
